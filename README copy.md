# Week 2 Challenge 

## Description

I wrote this page to try and better understand the inner workings of CSS.I learned a lot writing this code from scratch and look forward to resubmitting this project with a better understanding at a later date.



## Usage

The idea is to use this page as a portfolio for my current and future work. Attached is links to my personal Github and Instagram account.


## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
